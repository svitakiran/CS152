# This module tests the cullElephants function in elephant.py
# Call it like this:
#    python3 test_cullElephants.py
# Because I have seeded the random number generator, the output will be identical every time you run it. You should see:
#
#
#
# NOTE: The following statistics were calculated in Python2, which seems to have had a slightly different                             
# random number generator. Your results will be close to the following, but will likely not match exactly. 
#
#
# Test 1
# We needed to cull 1000 elephants and 1000 elephants were culled
# Out of 1000 calves before culling, approximately 909 should remain after culling. 933 remain.
# 
# Test 2
# We needed to cull 0 elephants and 0 elephants were culled
# Out of 0 calves before culling, approximately 0 should remain after culling. 0 remain.
# 
# Test 3
# We needed to cull 10000 elephants and 10000 elephants were culled
# Out of 10000 calves before culling, approximately 5000 should remain after culling. 5019 remain.
# If you would like it to change from run to run, then comment out the call to random.seed.
